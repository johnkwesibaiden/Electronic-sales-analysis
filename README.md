###  Project Overview 
This project aims to know customer purchase behavior by an electronics company over a one-year period, spanning from September 2023 to September 2024. By analyzing the various aspects of the sales data, I seek to identify trends and make data driven recommendations, and gain a deeper understanding of the customer purchasing behavior.

###  Data Sources
Sales Data:  The primary dataset used for this analysis is the "Electronic_sales_Sep2023-Sep2024.csv" file, containing detailed information about each customer purchase.


###   Tools
- Excel   -  Data Cleaning 
- Python  -  Data Analysis
- Power BI  - Creating reports


###   Data Cleaning / Preparation
In the initial data  preparation phase, I performed the following tasks:
1.  Data loading and Inspection
2. Handling missing values
3. Data cleaning and formatting


###   Exploratory Data Analysis
EDA involved exploring the sales data to answer key questions, such as
-  What is the overall sales trend?
-  Which products are  top sellers?
-  What are the relationships in the sales patterns?


###  Data Analysis
``` Python
Univariate analysis
Bivariate analysis
Data correlation
```


###  Results/Findings
The analysis results are summerized as follows:
1. The customers were between the ages of 18 years to 80 years
2. The products with the highest and least purchased were smartphone and Headphone respectively.
3. Out of the 20000 orders placed, 13432 were completed while 6568 were cancelled.
4. Credit card payment was the most preferred payment method while the Dedit  Card was the least preferred.
5. The company had five main shipping types;  most customers patronized    the 'Standard type' while the least opted the 'Expedited shipping type'.
6. Out of the Product ratings of  1 to 5 stars, majorityof the customers rated 3 stars.
7. Count of Ad-on purchase is 15132.
8. Majority of the customers were males.
9. There was absolutely no relationship or correlation in the customers purchasing behavior.
10. Random customers(non-loyal members) rather patronized most of the products than the loyal members.


###  Recommendations
Based on the analysis, I recommend the following actions:
-   Attractive packages must be put in place to maintain the new customer pool.
-   Periodic advertisements should be sent to the new customers and loyal members about our new and improved products and services. 
- Attempts should be made to reach out to our loyal members to find out some of the ways/recommendations to improve our servicesto them to ensure customer satisfaction; improving customer relations.
-  Focus on expanding  and promoting on less patronized products.
-   Reasons for most customer rating  3 stars must be found.
-   More varieties of ad-ons should be made available, displayed  either in-store or online and if possible, suggested to customers to increase ad-ons purchases.
